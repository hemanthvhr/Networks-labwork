To compile the ping program type the following command
	gcc -o ping ping.c -w
or use make command
The normal usage of the ping program is as follows
	sudo su
	<your root password>
	./ping <host name/ip>
		or
	./ping <host name/ip> <no of packets>
The ping.c program uses icmp struct in ip_icmp.h to create the icmp echo request/reply packets
There are the main functions
	pack :
	It takes a character buffer and packs the given data into a icmp echo request packet
	It also timestamps the packet with date
	unpack :
	It takes a character array and extracts the icmp data from that and stores the rtt in the RTT array
	chksum :
	It takes a character array and packet size and calculates the checksum of the packet
	send_packet:
	It creates all packets by calling the pack() and sends it to the host with a 1 second time in between each send
	recv_packet:
	It waits to receive all the packets and calls unpack() each time with timestamp of received time
	main :
	It prepares the dest_addr,opens a raw-socket and calls the send and recv packets functions
Observations:
	The round trip time calculated here is atleast one second because we are waiting one second before sending each packet and we are 		receiving after all the packets have been sent.
 	To reduce the rtt calculated we can use two threads each for sending and recv packets functions or wait for reply before sending next 		packet.
